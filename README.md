# CLT-Demo
This is a simple RShiny application about the Central Limit Theorem, inspired by my short stint as a Teaching Assistant for an intro to statistics course during undergrad. I hope to update it with more interactive visualisations on common theorems. If you think you might find it useful, feel free to run it on RStudio using - runGitHub( "CLT-Demo", "preranahiriyur")
