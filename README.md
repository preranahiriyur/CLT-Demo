# CLT-Demo
This is very simple RShiny application about the Central Limit Theorem, inspired by my short stint as a Teaching Assistant for an intro to statistics course during undergrad! If you think it might be useful in your class, feel free to run it on RStudio using - runGitHub( "CLT-Demo", "preranahiriyur")!
