# CLT-Demo
This is a simple RShiny application about the Central Limit Theorem, inspired by my short stint as a Teaching Assistant for an intro to statistics course during undergrad. I hope to update it with more interactive visualisations on common theorems in statistics. It can be viewed on RStudio by running - runGitHub( "CLT-Demo", "preranahiriyur")
